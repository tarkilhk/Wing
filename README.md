# Wing

**Your agent, with you**

Continue a conversation, steer running work, and send the next idea from your Android phone. Wing connects to a [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) server that you control or have access to.

## Your Hermes workflow, on your phone

- **Talk naturally.** Stream replies, inspect reasoning and tool activity, read code and tables, search within a chat, and open images, PDFs, Markdown, media and supported diagrams.
- **Stay in control.** Steer or stop work, queue a follow-up, review supported approvals, inspect subagents and goals, and return to a chat after a connection interruption. Unsent drafts and staged files survive navigation and restart.
- **Bring ideas from Android.** Attach photos and files, review content shared from another app, dictate into an editable draft, and read replies aloud. Choose on-device or Hermes speech processing separately for input and output.
- **Organize your workspace.** Switch connections and profiles, browse projects and pinned chats, filter active work, and use launcher shortcuts for Quick Chat, Activity and Search chats.
- **Operate your agent.** Manage supported profile settings, model access, MCP connectors and scheduled tasks. Check server and profile health, run diagnostics, and explore usage in Hermes analytics.
- **Keep the phone in the loop.** Get local progress, reply and approval notifications while Wing is connected. Backup or restore connection and app preferences, optionally protected with a passphrase.

Wing is an independent Android client for upstream Hermes. Features that require server support follow the capabilities of your connected Hermes version. [Explore the feature guide](docs/FEATURES.md) and [known limitations](docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

## Get started

1. Have a compatible Hermes dashboard and Desktop Gateway reachable from your phone. Use HTTPS or an encrypted private network for remote access.
2. Install a signed APK from the [latest release](https://github.com/tarkilhk/Wing/releases/latest). **arm64-v8a** is right for most current phones; the release also lists other architectures and checksums.
3. Follow the [setup guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) to connect, choose a profile and send your first message.

Wing requires Android 7.0 or later. It does not host a model or AI service on your phone. An API key for the older Hermes API-only transport is not enough for the dashboard and Desktop Gateway connection.

## Support Wing

If Wing makes your Hermes setup more useful, you can help fund its development. Support is optional; every feature is available either way.
