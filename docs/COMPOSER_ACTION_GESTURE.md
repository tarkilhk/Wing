# Composer actions

When a chat is idle, the composer sends your message. While a turn is working and the composer is empty, its button shows **Stop**; tap it to interrupt that turn.

Typing or adding an attachment restores the arrow button. For a working chat, its default action is **Steer**. Choose Steer, Queue or Stop as your device default in App settings. Idle chats and slash commands use Send.

## Choose another action

Hold the arrow button, slide to a choice in the vertical selector, then release to act. The default is nearest the button. Slide outside to cancel. Choosing another action does not change your saved default.

Unavailable choices are dimmed and explain why they cannot run. An attachment-only draft cannot be steered. Queue waits for an in-flight send to finish before moving the draft. You can keep typing while it waits.

With an empty composer during a working turn, the button offers only Stop. Navigation, backgrounding and changed action availability dismiss an open selector without acting.

Screen readers provide named actions on the button. With a hardware keyboard, Tab reaches it; Enter or Space runs the available primary action. Down arrow, Menu or Shift+F10 opens its menu. Arrow keys select, Enter runs and Escape closes it.

## Steer and queue

Accepted steering appears in the conversation as a compact compass row. Rejected steering or a connection failure keeps the draft. Text typed while a request is pending remains separate.

Queued prompts appear above the composer. Open an entry for its queue actions; saving and paused states remain visible. A failed save restores the draft. See [Queues and pending input](SUPERVISION_AND_QUEUES.md) and [Drafts and outgoing messages](DRAFTS_OUTBOX.md).

Branch/Fork is an action on a saved answer, rather than a composer action. See [Conversation actions](CONVERSATION_ACTIONS_AND_READING.md).
