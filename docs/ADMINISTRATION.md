# Administration

Open **Hermes administration**, **Hermes health** or **Hermes analytics** from Wing's navigation drawer.

| Destination | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| Hermes administration | Models, identity, skills, provider access, MCP connectors and scheduled tasks for the selected profile. |
| Hermes health | Host resources, server diagnostics and profile checks. |
| Hermes analytics | Activity, token usage and estimated costs. |

[Bot settings](BOTS.md#profile-options) opens these editors for the chosen bot. Changing settings there does not switch the selected chat's profile or model.

## Profile settings

Select the profile before opening an editor. Administration search takes you to the matching setting. Refresh updates the displayed configuration; it does not run diagnostics or test tools.

You can manage model defaults and supported reasoning options, identity and instructions, fallback models, memory settings, approval policy, compression, voice and scheduled tasks. Model defaults apply to new conversations; use the model selector inside a chat to change that conversation's model. [Profile voice](PROFILE_VOICE.md) explains speech synthesis settings.

Long-press a profile pill to choose its color. This device preference also colors the profile in Chats; it does not change settings on Hermes.

Settings and Identity show unsaved changes and offer Save and Close. If another client changed a field, compare **Current server value** with **Your value**, choose which to keep, then save. A failed or incomplete save keeps the form available for review. Refresh failures retain the last confirmed observation with its check time.

## Skills, tools and provider access

**Skills and tools** groups capabilities into Needs setup, Enabled capabilities and Not enabled. Enabling a capability may start setup on Hermes; enablement alone does not prove it is ready.

Installed skills offers instruction reading, recorded usage and available edit, archive or uninstall actions. Bundled instructions are read-only. The instruction reader supports raw/formatted views, copying, sharing and Contents. Hold or drag its grip to browse sections and release to jump. Skill discovery, the library and agent plugins have separate destinations.

Provider access belongs to the selected profile. Depending on the provider and credential source, Wing offers key management, sign-in, renewal, status checks and removal. Some external CLI logins must be completed on the server. Removing a saved sign-in does not revoke the provider account or necessarily clear credentials already in use.

Retained memory can be searched and read. Memory entry editing and deletion are unavailable. See [MCP connectors](MCP_CONNECTORS.md) for connector setup, sign-in and reconnection.

## Scheduled tasks

Open **Profile → Scheduled tasks** to create, edit, pause, resume, run or delete routines. Search and the All, Active, Paused and Needs attention filters affect this list. Open a task for instructions, delivery, model, last-run details and recent runs.

Schedules include recurring intervals, daily/weekly/monthly choices, one-time dates or delays, and custom expressions. Server templates provide starting points. Recurrences use Hermes time; run timestamps display in phone time. Editing a name or instructions preserves an unchanged schedule.

**Save on server** stores results on Hermes. Other delivery choices depend on the connected server's configured destinations and may need setup there. A model override applies to that task; Profile default is resolved when it runs.

**Run now** may take as long as the task itself. Leaving the screen does not cancel or repeat it. A paused task asks you to confirm **Resume and run**. Pausing a schedule does not stop a run already underway. If a response is lost, review the uncertainty notice before attempting another run or creating another task.

Recent runs starts with 20 records and can expand to the latest 100. Agent runs open their conversation; script runs show available output and errors. Wing does not offer a task-specific Stop action, script upload or a workflow builder. Hermes runs schedules even when Wing is closed.

## Health checks and diagnostics

Health displays **Host**, **Server** and **Profile** separately. Each section has its own refresh and check time; there is no combined healthy verdict.

Host shows the connected machine's CPU, memory, disk, uptime and load when available. Tap the machine row for more details. Disk readings describe the Hermes data volume; process memory describes the API process, rather than all agents. Missing measurements stay unavailable.

Server contains Doctor, security audit and Logs. Its refresh runs both diagnostics. They also run on first entry and when a completed result is at least 24 hours old. Open a diagnostic for its output and rerun action. Leaving Health keeps an accepted diagnostic running. Results survive restarting Wing; an unfinished run is checked again without automatically starting another copy.

Doctor findings can offer **Ask Hermes**, which opens an editable draft containing the finding and available log. Review and send it yourself. Wing does not perform Doctor repairs. Logs supports source, severity and submitted text search, with up to 100 lines.

Profile checks cover model access, tool setup, connectors and scheduled tasks. Saved results are reused for up to 24 hours; refresh runs them again. These checks do not send a model prompt, execute tools or run jobs. A connector test can start its configured program. Resolved credentials do not prove available quota or successful model inference. **What's checked?** explains each result's limits.

Reported access problems offer the relevant recovery action, such as **Fix access**, **Review access**, **Retry** or **Review connection**. Routine model selection and account management remain in Administration. A failed refresh retains the previous result and time, qualified as last known.

## Health alerts

Open **Hermes health → Alert settings**. Settings apply on this device across active connections. Memory and disk usage warnings start above 90% for two minutes and clear below 85% for two minutes. CPU warnings start disabled; their editable defaults are 95%, 80% and three minutes.

Warning and recovery durations can be set independently from 1 to 30 minutes. The clear percentage must be lower than the alert percentage. Valid edits save automatically; invalid text keeps the last valid rule. A failed save offers Retry.

Memory and disk also have separate **Native Hermes critical pressure alert** switches, enabled initially. These alerts can appear immediately even without a percentage reading. They are independent of the configurable usage warnings.

Wing watches while foregrounded or while its existing background task monitoring is active. Health alerts do not keep monitoring running by themselves. Paused or failed readings can leave an issue qualified as last known. Doctor and security audit findings do not generate these alerts.

The toolbar bell appears while issues remain. Tap it to browse issues, then tap an alert or its open icon to reach the settings where you can act. A connector alert opens the failed connector directly; if several failed, the connector list marks them. Profile alerts keep the connection and profile captured by the check. Resource alerts open Hermes health. Tapping a brief notice opens the same destination. Dismissing a notice keeps the issue; recovery clears it. Backend connection failures never create health alerts; the connection LED shows availability and recovery. These are in-app alerts and do not require Android notification permission.

## Analytics

Analytics offers **1D, 7D, 30D, 90D and 365D** periods, a daily token grid and model/token breakdowns. Chart titles and Tokens/Cost controls change the displayed grouping. Refresh reloads observations; missing costs and partial coverage remain identified.

OpenAI Codex subscription usage shows an **API-equivalent cost** using current direct OpenAI API base rates from models.dev. Other providers retain Hermes's estimate. Mixed history shows **Estimated usage value**. These values are estimates, not invoices or historical price reconstruction; cache-write charges, long-context premiums and service-tier adjustments are excluded. Missing prices leave the affected amount unavailable.

Daily records and model totals can cover different usage, and period edges may include partial days. Use the displayed coverage notes when comparing charts.
